An Introduction to Google Earth Engine for Complete Beginners.

You can find a self-paced version of this workshop, and others, on our [ArcGIS Online landing page](https://stanford.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html).

## Meet Earth Engine

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform that empowers researchers to process and analyze satellite imagery and geospatial datasets at scale. As a Stanford researcher, GEE enables you to conduct data-driven science, develop geospatial algorithms, and address global challenges using planetary-scale data resources.

Earth Engine provides:

- An interactive environment for developing and running geospatial analyses
- Access to a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and scientific datasets
- Tools for detecting changes, mapping trends, and quantifying differences on the Earth's surface

The Earth Engine API allows you to create custom workflows for processing raster and vector data. This onboarding session is designed for Stanford researchers interested in leveraging GEE for remote sensing and geospatial analysis, even without extensive local computing resources.

**Session Overview:**

- Introduction to the Earth Engine platform and its capabilities
- Overview of remote sensing concepts
- Hands-on exercises using the Earth Engine JavaScript Code Editor
- Guidance on accessing imagery, creating composites, running analyses, and exporting results

**Prerequisites:**
No prior experience with Earth Engine or JavaScript is required. Familiarity with programming, remote sensing, or GIS concepts is helpful but not mandatory.

**Getting Started:**
This workshop is tailored for Stanford University affiliates, most of whom should already have access to Google Earth Engine. If you are unable to access the Google Earth Engine Code Editor, please email **stanford-geospatial@stanford.edu** to request access.

For the best experience, use a modern Chromium-based browser.

If you are not a Stanford affiliate, you can request access to Google Earth Engine at:  [https://signup.earthengine.google.com](https://signup.earthengine.google.com)

## The Sample Scripts

Once you have signed up for and received confirmation of your Google Earth Engine account, you can copy the script repository for this webinar by clicking on the following link, which will redirect you to the Google Earth Engine Code Editor and import a series of scripts designed to introduce you to the basic mechanics of working in Google Earth Engine:

## The Instructor's Guide

This one doesn't really have a tutorial text, since it's really about looking at the code, and what it is doing. The code in the Sample Scripts above is well-commented, and should make for a pretty straightforward walk-through. For those that like to read, the following is the original instructors notes document I used as a jumping off point for this workshop. Much of it will be redundant, if you watch the video, but a few things, like the difference between running things locally, or on the server, I just gloss over, and are better covered, here:

## More Earth Engine

As noted, this webinar is a modified version of the Google Earth Outreach Team's own beginning workshop. You can find more materials to help you learn to use Google Earth Engine at:  [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine)

Here are some highlights:

* The Google Earth Engine Data Catalog -  [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets)  - Earth Engine's 100+ Petabyte public data archive includes more than forty years of historical imagery and scientific datasets, updated and expanded daily.
* JavaScript, REST and Python Guides -  [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides)  -  Google Earth Engine includes Python, JavaScript and REST APIs. The Quickstart for the REST API can be found, here:  [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/Quickstart)
* The Google Earth Engine Developers Group represents nearly a decade of support and open development on the Google Earth Engine platform. If you can't find the answer you are looking for in the archive, the members of this forum are friendly, prompt and helpful with GEE questions:  [https://groups.google.com/g/google-earth-engine-developers](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/Quickstart)
